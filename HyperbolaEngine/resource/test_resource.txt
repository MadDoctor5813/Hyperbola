snap back to reality
oh there goes gravity
oh there goes rabbit
he choked he's so mad but he
won't give up that easy
nope he won't have it he
he knows his whole back's to these ropes
it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke
when he goes back to his mobile home that's when it
back to the lab again yo, his whole rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope you don't pass it
